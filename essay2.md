## First Impressions

Every businessperson knows that a good first impression is valuable, but mastering the subtlety can be challenging.
Researchers at the University of Limerick, Ireland studied one such subtlety, the inclusion of an author's middle initial in an academic publication.
Their 2014 paper [discovered a causal relationship](https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/5412/Igou_2014_middle.pdf?sequence=4) between the inclusion of a middle initial in an academic publication and the reader's evaluation of the publication.
Their experiment used 85 Limerick undergraduates in randomized laboratory trials.

The researchers proposed that we have been conditioned to see more formal titles in an academic setting, notably a middle initial.
Therefore the mechanism by which a middle initial causes a higher evaluation is that people associate the middle initial to an established mental pattern matching formal academic work.
Patterns like this are useful at an individual level, for example any researcher who believes the thesis of this paper would be wise to include their middle initial on future publications.
There are also business applications to this insight, especially in online advertising where people make a decision whether to click based on many poorly understood factors.
Perhaps the inclusion of a middle initial in certain contexts could drive more clicks.

## Next experiment

experiment: how does name drive clicks? how does first name's popularity affect evaluation? should it be online ad focused?
